#Q1 How is DevOps diiferent from Traditional Software Development?

* Focus on flow of value, not conformance to project plan
* Production-first mindest
* Culture of shared ownsership and cooperation
* Rapid iteration with fast feedback loops
* Automate, automate, automate
* Infrastructure is treated as flexible rsource.

#Q2 What DevOps practices can I levarage to expediate software deliery and improve quality?

* Continous Integration
* Continous Deployment
* Continuous Testing
* Applicaton Performace Monitoring (APM)
* Testing in production

#Q 10 Effective Continuous Integration
* Put everything under source control
* Automate the build process
* Unit Testing /Code Analysis as part of build
* Fix broken build quickly
* Monitor build quality
* Build once, deploy many times

# Q4 Continous Deployment
* Put everything in a source control
* Never deploy or configure resources manually - sript and automate
* Make it fast - move to Cloud if that's what it takes
* Make your deployments idempotent

# Q5 How do I use Infrastructure as a Code and onfiguration as a Code to improve scalbilty?
* Treat Infrastrucure as a flexible resource
* Never deploy or configure resources manually - script and automate
* Parameterize your scripts so that you're using the same script in every enviornment
* Always "deploy everything" (idempotency)
* Architect for scale

# Q6 What type of testing should I conduct and how do I conduct these test?

* Builds: Unit Tests(no external dependencies)
* Dev/Int environments: Integration/ Functional Tests
* Staging: Load Tests
* Production: Smoke/Availabilty Tests
* Production/ A/B Testing
* Manual/ Exploratory Testing - but prefer autoamtion

# Q 7 How do Developers and Operations team work together to manage software reslese effectively ?

* Put everything into source ontrol
* Never deploy or configure resources manually - script and automate
* Work together -shared ownership
* Shared Ownership - especially of Production (Operations)

# Q 8 How Do I integratre hypothesis-driven developement into our software development porcess?
* Formulate hypothesi with clearly measurable criteria
* Deploy - quiclky
* Monitor (APM)
* (Dont be afraid) Fail fast
* Learm from Production- groom the backlog accordingly

# Q 9 What DevOps tools or practices can help me learn from Production ?
*  Application Performane Monitoring Insights, Log Analysis, Nagios, New Relic
*  Monitor "business metrics" as well performance and availabilty
* Measure value from the user perspective


#Q 10 If I want DevOps, should I use Scrum or Learn or Kanban?
* Yes, yes, Yes !! Any iterative framework that minimizes cycle time work well
* Culture is a critical component of DevOps, so invest in it.
* Take the best of Scrum| Learn| Kanban and adapt it to your team and environment
